# Velcro

Manage your dependencies with homebrew like you manage your gems with
bundler.

## Getting Started

1. Install the gem

   ```bash
   gem install velcro
   ```

2. Open up a project and install dependencies

   ```bash
   velcro install
   ```

   If this is the first time you are installing the project a `Brewfile`
   and `Brewfile.lock` will be generated.

3. Update a dependency to the most recent version

   ```bash
   velcro update redis
   ```

   This will update the version in the `Brewfile.lock`.
